Running a stats test is the easy part (interpreting the results of that test is a whole other thing though). The hard part of any data analysis is getting the data into shape to be explored and analysed. \n\n## What this course is\n\nThis short-course provides an introduction to data wrangling, plotting, and reproducible research practices using the statistical computing programme [_R_](//www.r-project.org/){ target=\"_blank\" } and the distributed version control system [_git_](//git-scm.com/){ target=\"_blank\" }. To facilitate the workflow of using _R_ and _git_, we will use [_RStudio_](//www.rstudio.com){ target=\"_blank\" }, an integrated development environment (IDE) for _R_ that includes support for _git_. In addition, you will learn to use [_GitHub_](//github.com/){ target=\"_blank\" }, a web-based _git_ repository hosting service. _GitHub_ is an essential tool for producing reproducible and open data analysis.\n",
