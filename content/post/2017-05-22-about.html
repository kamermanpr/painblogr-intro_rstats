<h2>What this course is not</h2>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> an introductory statistics course. Running a stats test is the easy part (interpreting the results of that test is a whole other thing though). The hard part of any data analysis is getting the data into shape to be explored and analysed.</p>

<h2>What this course is</h2>
<p>This short-course provides an introduction to data wrangling, plotting, and reproducible research practices using the statistical computing programme <a href="//www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><em>R</em></a> and the distributed version control system <a href="//git-scm.com/" target="_blank"><em>git</em></a>. To facilitate the workflow of using <em>R</em> and <em>git</em>, we will use <a href="//www.rstudio.com" target="_blank"><em>RStudio</em></a>, an integrated development environment (IDE) for <em>R</em> that includes support for <em>git</em>. In addition, you will learn to use <a href="//github.com/" target="_blank"><em>GitHub</em></a>, a web-based <em>git</em> repository hosting service. <em>GitHub</em> is an essential tool for producing reproducible and open data analysis.</p>
