<h2>Seeing Theory</h2>
<p><strong>A visual introduction to probability and statistics</strong></p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you go play around with the interactive plots at <a href="http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/" target="_blank"><em>Seeing Theory</em></a>. The project was designed and created by <em>Daniel Kunin</em> with support from Brown Universityâ€™s Royce Fellowship Program and National Science Foundation group STATS4STEM. The goal of the project is to make statistics more accessible to a wider range of students through interactive visualizations.</p>
